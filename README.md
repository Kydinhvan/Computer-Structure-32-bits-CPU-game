# Bit Blasters: 16x16 FPGA Arcade Shooter

![Poster](poster.png)

## Overview
Bit Blasters is a fast-paced arcade-style shooter built entirely from scratch on an FPGA platform, designed around a custom-built 32-bit Beta CPU. It showcases an integrated system with custom FSM logic, datapath, RAM/ROM access, register file design, ALU operations, and real-time interaction via LED matrix and user input.

## System Architecture
The system consists of the following main modules:

- **Custom 32-bit Beta CPU**
- **Finite State Machine (FSM)** for control logic
- **LED Matrix Driver** for rendering graphics
- **Register File** for storing game state
- **ALU with Extended Instructions**
- **ROM & RAM** for game logic and dynamic state
- **User Input (buttons)** for control
- **7-Segment Display** for timer and score

### FSM Control Logic 
The FSM manages the game flow with multiple states:
- **Initialization**: Sets up enemies, resets state
- **Idle**: Listens for player inputs
- **Bullet Logic**: Handles bullet color, movement, and encoding
- **Enemy Wave Logic**: Spawns new enemies upon wave clear
- **Collision Detection**: Checks for valid hits based on bullet color and coordinates
- **Timer Management**: Countdown from 60 seconds using slow clock
- **End Game**: Displays score and halts game

The FSM is designed as a **Mealy machine**, where outputs depend on both the current state and inputs.

### Register File (REGFILE)
- **21 registers**, each 32-bit wide
- Addressed via 5-bit select lines
- Holds player position, bullet data, score, timer, and enemy information
- Encoded data formats for efficient use:
  - **[23:16]**: X position
  - **[15:8]**: Y position
  - **[7:0]**: Color (RGB)

### ALU Design
Three new ALU operations were implemented:

- **Enemy Color Encode (6'b111101)**: Quickly marks enemy as inactive by overwriting color
- **Bullet Color Encode (6'b111110)**: Combines bullet x, y, and color into one word
- **Bullet Y Movement Encode (6'b111111)**: Updates bullet Y only, reducing states

These enhance game responsiveness by reducing FSM transitions and simplifying comparisons.

### RAM & ROM
- **RAM (2048 bits)**:
  - 256 pixels Ã— 3 bits/pixel = 768 bits used for RGB matrix
  - Extra space ensures smooth refresh cycles
- **ROM**:
  - Stores static content: wave data, endgame screen, patterns

### Datapath Components
- Dual-port REGFILE with WE control
- ROM/RAM I/O mapped to screen matrix
- WDSEL multiplexers to combine ROM outputs for enemy configuration
- CU takes inputs from:
  - Clock edges (game timer, animation)
  - User input
  - Enemy and bullet state flags

### LED Matrix Display
- Controlled via WS2812B driver
- Driven from RAM content updated by FSM + CPU logic
- Refresh cycles managed by dedicated slow clock

### UI Interaction
- **7 Buttons**: LEFT, RIGHT, RED, GREEN, BLUE, START, RESET
- **Score/Timer**: 2-digit 7-segment display via decoded register output
- **Matrix**: Player, bullets, and enemies updated in real time
